# Best Factors in Predicting Alcohol Abuse in Teenagers Using Tree-based Models                                    
### Mar 2023 – April 2023
### Tools Used: R Studio, ML Models
•	This research used data from National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to perform analysis and examine the accuracy of Tree-based models in determining the factors that influence teen alcohol abuse

•	Performed Data pre-processing and Imputed missing values statistically and Feature Selection using Information gain. 

•	Three models were developed to understand the influential factors. The first model using a decision tree predicts whether a teen has ever consumed alcohol with an error rate of 14.2%. The second model using the Random Forest algorithm classifies the alcohol users into the following categories: seldom, sometimes, frequent, and never used with an error rate of 13.5%. The third model using Boosting predicts the frequency of alcohol usage by a teenager in a year with a mean square error of 120.
